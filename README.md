## My process

I started designing it with desktop view and after i had completed my design and then i used media query to design the mobile view and i lke it more convinient to me to design it that way.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

I learned how to use bootstrap and grid more clearly and als how to overwrite some of the bootstrap codes with my custom made css.
```
